## _My_ Challenge

> I encourage you to begin the course with a specific challenge in mind in relation to your child or adolescent.

Figure out a way to:
* drink more with less resistance.
* be able to listen a complete short story without much interruption or rushing through pages.
* get teeth brushed every morning and evening without fuss.

# Week 1

## 1. Praise

Definition: **Praise** is a way of expressing one's approval. It's a temporary program to make permanent changes. Get the behavior, then you stop praising for that. It is _a_ tool among others â€• don't expect it to work alone.

Mechanics: Support repeated practice to build habit(s).

This will _not_ spoil a child.

### Kinds

1. routine ("praise in everyday life") â€• helps maintaining relationship;
2. changing/developing behavior â€• better suited.

### Features

0. SELECT THE BEHAVIOR TO PRAISE (and Look for the desired behavior to appear).
0. **Very** enthusiastic! ~ Gestures + facial expression + up tone of voice.
0. State exactly what is being praised. E.g. "Great! You've picked up toys just like I asked you!"
0. Non-verbal. Hugs, kisses, high-five, etc.

### Effectiveness

* Timely, ideally praise immediately after the desired behavior occured.
* Praise even the small increments of behavior.

### Caution

* Do not apply routine praise to change behavior â€• it doesn't work that way.
* Do not praise the person. E.g. "You're a good girl because you did/did not do X" â€• BAD!
* Do not love depends on behavior. E.g. "Daddy loves you because you did/did not do X" â€• BAD!
* Do not focus on yourself. E.g. "You make daddy happy when you do X" â€• BAD!
* Do not "caboose". I.e. no extra phrases after the praise like "why don't you always do X?" â€• BAD!

## Components of behavior development

A â€• B â€• C

***A*ntecedents** refers to what can be done _before_ behavior takes place to make the desired behaviors more likely to occur.

***B*ehavior** refers to what you can do to get the specific behaviors you wish.

***C*onsequences** is what we do _after_ the behavior is completed.

## 2. Antecedents
