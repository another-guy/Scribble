## _My_ Challenge <!-- omit in toc -->

> I encourage you to begin the course with a specific challenge in mind in relation to your child or adolescent.

Figure out a way to:
* drink more with less resistance.
* be able to listen a complete short story without much interruption or rushing through the pages of the book.
* get teeth brushed every morning and evening without fuss.

## Key Ideas

* **Temporary tools to achieve permanent effects**.
* **It is _Practice_ that builds habits of doing good things/not doing bad things**.

# Week 1 <!-- omit in toc -->

## Components of behavior development

A â€• B â€• C

***A*ntecedents** refers to what can be done _before_ behavior takes place to make the desired behaviors more likely to occur.

***B*ehavior** refers to what you can do to get the specific behaviors you wish.

***C*onsequences** is what we do _after_ the behavior is completed.

## 1. Praise

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Praise`** is a way of expressing one's approval.
It's a temporary program to make permanent changes.
Get the behavior, then you stop praising for that.
It is _a_ tool among others â€• don't expect it to work alone.

Mechanics: Support repeated practice to build habit(s).

This will _not_ spoil a child.

### Kinds <!-- omit in toc -->

1. routine ("praise in everyday life") â€• helps maintaining relationship;
2. changing/developing behavior â€• better suited.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

* Select the behavior to praise in advance and then look for it to appear.
* **Be VERY enthusiastic!**
   ~ Gestures + facial expression + up tone of voice.
* **State exactly what is being praised.**
   E.g. "Great! You've picked up toys just like I asked you!"
* **Use non-verbal supporting actions:** Hugs, kisses, high-five, etc.

### Effectiveness <!-- omit in toc -->

* Timely, ideally praise immediately after the desired behavior occured.
* Praise even the small increments of behavior.

### EXAMPLE <!-- omit in toc -->

TODO


### Caution <!-- omit in toc -->

* Do not apply routine praise to change behavior â€• it doesn't work that way.
* Do not praise the person.
   E.g. "You're a good girl because you did/did not do X" â€• BAD!
* Do not love depends on behavior.
   E.g. "Daddy loves you because you did/did not do X" â€• BAD!
* Do not focus on yourself.
   E.g. "You make daddy happy when you do X" â€• BAD!
* Do not "caboose".
   I.e. no extra phrases after the praise like "why don't you always do X?" â€• BAD!

## 2. Antecedents

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Antecedent`** is an action or statement that increase the likelyhood the behavior will occur.

Whether the behavior will occur more or less likely depends on the delivery.
Half-joke example:

> â€• She: If you _really loved me_ you would go to the family event with me.
> 
> â€• He: If _you really loved me_ you would not even ask me to go.

### Kinds <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Prompts â€• direct ways to guide behavior usually in a form of instruction.
   * Verbal: "Please put away your toys".
   * Physical: Walking child to a bathroom to brush teeth holding him/her by hand.
   * Visual: "Here, let me show you how to brush your teeth."
2. Positive Setting Events â€• indirect ways to guide behavior by setting the stage.
   * Usually is related to _how_ something is said or presented.
3. Negative Setting Events â€• indirect ways to decrease the behavior you want.
   * Harsh tone alone or limiting choice are likely to make child not follow instructions. E.g. "do it because I said so", "I am the parent and you have to do this".
   * Aggressive orders are not the way to build habits.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

* **Be clear and specific.**
  General prompts are less effective than the specific ones.
  - E.g. "Pick up five pieces of cloth before coming to dinner" or "Pick up all clothes from the floor and move them to the laubdry room" are better than "Go clean your room".
* **Consider how you're making a request.**
  - Use gentle tone of voice, and matching facial expression to increase the chances of compliance.
* **Offer choices**.
   It increases chances child will comply right away.
* **Say *please***.
   It may be helpful because it is normally said in soft voice and implies choice.
* **Offer assistance**.
   It conveys a gentle mindset, willing to be there, and readiness to attend child.
   Sometimes, starting a thing is the most difficult part.
   Start assistance â€•> observe when behavior appears â€•> withdraw assistance.
* **Use playful challenge** (or even a couple of time in a raw).
   Prolong practice and achieve behavior locking earlier.
   "I bet you can't do it twice in a raw."

### EXAMPLE <!-- omit in toc -->

### FAQ <!-- omit in toc -->

> I give prompts all day and trust me they don't work at all.

Well, giving too many prompts too often is called *nagging*.

Prompts get the behavior going but praise is needed to support it.

> How long do I have to keep giving prompts to see the positive results?

Key is: how often can you praise the behavior.
When you see behavior after a prompt was given, **praise it**.
When you see behavior without a prior prompt, **REALLY PRAISE IT!**

Normally it can take somewhere between 1 to 3 weeks.
The tools are **designed for short-term use but they lead to long-term change**.

## 3. Behaviors â€• Shaping

*How can we get to behavior of the child that we'd like to see?*

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Shaping`** is rewarding small steps that begin to approximate (resemble) the desired behavior.

E.g. Start with 10 minutes of homework per day if want to achieve 1 hour.
Want a child to clear all the dishes from the dinner table => start with just one.

> When you develop _listening to you_ or _complience_ in one place, it carries over to other places.

Give special praise child for showing the behavior for _easy_ requests first.
This will increase chances of behavior in other situtaions.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

* Choose behaviors you'd like.
* Select a small step.
* Choose the consequence you will use (praise or points).
* Notice and reinforce the instances of behavior.
* When behavior instances occur consistently, make the requirement slightly .bigger
  * if you _don't_ see the progress, try to make the requirement smaller.

### EXAMPLE <!-- omit in toc -->

TODO


### FAQ <!-- omit in toc -->

> Why do I need to do shaping at all, my child knows how to do the behavior?

Knowing is not the same as doing. The idea is to make the child practicing the behavior and carry it over to different contexts.

> What if my child does not even do the first step in shaping?

Make the step smaller.
Provide a little help to get things going â€• it is totally fine. If it does not work still, try to use the [**Simulation technique**](#4-behaviors--simulation).

### Caution <!-- omit in toc -->

Avoid ineffective use!

* Do not set bar too high in the beginning.
* Avoid "slippery slope thinking".
  > "If I have to help little now, I will need to always keep helping".
  This is not true at all.
* Remember to praise but understand that shaping is not done for praise but for repetative practice and building a habit.

## 4. Behaviors â€• Simulation

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Simulation`** consists of making up practice opportunities to engage in the behavior in game-like, role-play, pretend situation.

It is intended to getting the behavior you'd like to see in your child (Or stop the behavior you don't want the child to do which she is doing a lot).

Simulation uses [**antecedents**](#2-Antecedents), [**praises**](#1-Praise), [**points**](#7-Consequences--Point-Programs), and developing [**positive opposites**](#6-Consequences--Positive-Opposite) techniques.

The idea is to build the behavior in artificial environment and then carry it over to real life situations.

For the simulation is important _how_ you do things, not just what you do.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

**Prerequisite**: Pressure-free, anxiety-free environment and time.
Make it fun!

* Choose a behavior to be corrected.
* Explain the game clearly.
* Play the game.
* Praise effusively.
* Use a playful challenge to repeat the practice one or two times.

### EXAMPLE <!-- omit in toc -->

TODO


### FAQ <!-- omit in toc -->

> If it looks so fake, how can it teach the behavior that will be used in every day situations?

Practice makes habits.
Habits do carry over from one situation to another.

> How often should I play the game?

Maybe one time a day.
Try including a challenge to repat the game.
Do praise the instances the behavior when you see them.

## 5. Behaviors â€• Modeling

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Modeling`** is a systematic tool that incorporates learning by observing and seeing the behavior of others rather than performing that behavior.

As it was said earlier, practice is crucial for learning, however the _initial learning_ often comes from observing.

Accidental observation of some behavior _is_ an example of modeling too.
E.g. daddy sweard,then the baby repeats the bad word.
Another example: children discipline their peers the same way their parents discipline them.

Children learn from diffent observed people, but parents modeling influence is the greatest due to the role in the child's life, the amount of time spent together, and the special relationship.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

* Select a characteristic to be developed.
* Define the characteristic by listing examples.
  * A few _concrete_ samples will suffice.
  The picked-up knowledge will be inferred, and carried over from the examples provided.
* Model the behavior as the occasions arise.
   Mentioned what you did when you're modeling the behavior.
* Praise any instance when child practices the bahavior.

Related: **Askable parent** â€• a parent child can come to ask about anything.
Remember to converse with the child about what is going on in your life.
If nothing happened today, tell a story about the past.
This sets and example of openness and willing to talk that the child will likely follow.

### EXAMPLE <!-- omit in toc -->

TODO


* TODO Alcohol abuse.
* TODO Parent shouting at children on the beach.

### FAQ <!-- omit in toc -->

> How effective is modeling in changing my child?

No guarantees here.
Children have different behavioral tendencies and parents can't change everything they want just because they provide modeling opportunities.
But parents are greatly increasing the chances of the positive changes in behavior.
Targeted modeling coupled with appropriate praise can be very efficient.

> How will I know modeling is working at all?

The efficiency of modeling depends on how often the desired behavior is demonstrated.
Sometimes, the child picks it up right away, but often it takes some time to develop.
Some behaviors occur very late in child's life, even when get their own children.

> Is there a way to determine which of my behaviors will be picked up by my child?

Probably not.
However, the most frequently demonstrated behaviors are the most likely to be learned.
What parents or other important people do is more likely to be picked up than what less important people do.

# Week 2 <!-- omit in toc -->

## 6. Consequences â€• Positive Opposite

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Positive opposite`** is a technique which replaces the punishment of the negative behavior with the focus on consistent praising of the opposite good behavior. 

You may be skeptical about the efficiency of this technique but a lot of research shows that it actually works.
People get skeptical because the technique is counterintuitive and we as human beings tend to focus on negative aspects of one's personality or behavior (*negativity bias*).

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

* Identify the negative behavior you want to reduce.
* Identify what the positive opposite behavior, i.e. what you want the child to do *instead*.
* Actively monitor for positive behavior and praise it whenever it occurs.
  * *"Catch the child being good."*

### EXAMPLE <!-- omit in toc -->

TODO

### FAQ <!-- omit in toc -->

> Why don't I just punish my child if he doesn't do what I ask of him?

Punishment is too easy to administer in a wrong way, with negative consequences.
More importantly, punishment only stops the negative behavior but doesn't teach the positive behavior.

> What do I do if the child is still doing the behavior I am trying to get rid of?

Positive opposite does not work immediately.
Do use mild punishment if necessary, such as temporary loss of a privilege.
But keep the emphasis on the positive opposite.
The more it gets praised, the faster it will get settled.

> For how long do we need to use positive opposites to get the resuls we want?

It is impossible to predict because behaviors are different, children are different, and periodicity of the technique application may be very different.
A couple or three weeks should be enough in most cases though.

### Slide <!-- omit in toc -->

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/another-guy/Scribble/master/notes/images/Alan-Kazdin--Everyday-Parenting--The-ABCs-of-Child-Rearing/positive_opposite.png)

## 7. Consequences â€• Point Programs (aka Token Economy)

Providing a positive consequence after your child engages in the behavior you want to develop is a very powerful tool.
These consequences are called "positive reinforcers".
The most important positive consequence that you can provide routinely is praise.

Unlike praise, points are tengible rewards that the child earns for engaging in positive behavior you'd like to develop.
The specific kind of token doesn't make any difference in how the program works.

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Point Program`** is a system of administering rewards to develop positive behavior.

It's a way of structuring rewards.
Points are like money.
They are earned by the child for behavior you want to develop.
They are spent like money on privileges or activities or other items of interest.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

* Specify a specific behavior to earn points.
* Choose a medium that will service points: stars, tickets, smily faces... anything works.
* Have a way of tracking points earned.
* List point values, i.e. how many points are granted for a particular behavior.
* Develop a reward menu which specifies what the points can buy and what the prices are.
  * E.g. staying up late, playing a game with a parent, extra time on the computer.
  * Food and snacks are BAD rewards.
  * Ask child for help with selecting the rewards.

### FAQ <!-- omit in toc -->

> The last thing I want to do is to give my child points for good behavior.
> Kid should just do the behavior when I ask and I should not need to use points or praise.

Yes, if the child does the behavior.
However, if the child does not do the behavior points program and praise can help.

## 9. Consequences â€• Punishment Basics

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Punishment`** is any consequence that follows behavior and decreases or is intended to decrease the likelihood of the behavior in the future.

It is important to understand all the effects of punishment.
Keep in mind is not an efficient tool with dangers associated.
It should only be administered as a supplement to other techniques.

### Kinds <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Presenting something undesireable or negative after a behavior occurs.
   E.g. Reprimands, shouting, hitting.
2. Taking away something positive after a behavior.
   E.g. Taking away an activity, privilege, or event.
   In [**points program**](#7-Consequences--Point-Programs) â€• the points can be taken away.
3. Using some effort or some task to be performed.
   E.g. a chore, or cleaning up something.

### Direct Effects <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Stop the behavior *in the moment* of the interruption.
2. Does **not** stop the behavior beyond the moment.
   The child will keep engaging into the behavior in future.
3. Parents tend to escalate the intencity and frequency or both over time.
   Such escalation increases crying and pain associated with the punishment but does **not** increase the effectiveness or teaches the behavior you'd like.

I.e. the effects are immediate but not enduring.

### Negative Side Effects <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Emotional reactions.
   E.g. crying, arguing, striking a parent.
2. Escape and avoidance.
   * When a parent delivers more punishment than praise, the child often try to distance themselves from the persons who punish them, both physically and psychologically.
   This straints the relationship between a parent and a child.
   * Similarly, the activity that is being used as a punishment may start being avoided too, however it actually may be a desired activity which we want children to like, such as doing (extra) homework, exercising, and so on.
3. Increase in aggressive behavior with you.
   That applies to contacts or any force applied during punishment.
   E.g. hitting, holding tight, physically force the child to [**Time Out**](#10-consequences--time-out-from-reinforcement) all lead to aggression.
4. Increase in aggressive behavior with others.
   Punish technique [**models**](#5-behaviors--modeling) the child tends to use with his/her peers.
   E.g. punishment by hitting âŸ¶ fights on playground, punishment byshouting âŸ¶ yelling at school.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

The **effective** punishment uses the following is done like this:

* Select a behavior to decrease.
   Writing down is a good idea.
* Identify the positive opposite of this behavior.
   It is even more important to write it down so that you know how you will be [**attending**](#8-consequences--attending--planned-ignoring) and [**praising**](#1-praise) them.
* Reward the positive opposite.
* Select a brief punishment *ahead of time*.
   E.g. time out, loss of privilege.
   **KEEP THE PUNISHMENT MILD.**
* Praise much more often than punish.

## 10. Consequences â€• Time Out from Reinforcement

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Time Out of Reinforcement`** â€• a brief period of time in which the child does not have access to the usual rewards in the situation.

It's a break from the attention and rewards available.
Examples of such rewards can be just being in the presence of others; receiving parent/peer attention; or participating in an ongoing game.

When in time out place, the child can not participate in activities and is not engaged into any conversations with anyone.
Time out is NOT related to thinking about what was done wrong, because it does not help building habits or change behavior.

During the time out the child should be let alone, but safe and supervised.
No talking.
No playing.
The time out place should not offer interesting activities; ideally it's a boring place.

Remember, however, that time out can only suppress the negative behavior but *does not teach* the positive one.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

* Decide what warrants a time out.
  * The child should know what those punishable behaviors are.
  Be explicit and specific about it.
  Write them down.
* Decide where to have a time out.
  * Should be boring but safe place that allows supervising.
* Decide the duration of a timeout.
  * 2 to 5 minutes work fine.
  10 minutes is a practical maximum.
* Have a back up punishing event in case the child does not go to time out.
  * Be ready to take away something.
  Offer a choice in a calm manner.
  E.g. if you don't go to time out now, you're not watching TV tonight.
  If the child does not comply, announce the immediate punishment and go away: Okay, you're not watching TV tonight.
  No arguments â€• it's too late.
* Explain how time out works.
  * Do it just to practice compliance in a tension-free environment.
* Keep an eye on the positive opposite behaviors during the *time in* and praise them.

### EXAMPLE <!-- omit in toc -->

### Caution <!-- omit in toc -->

* Do NOT physically force your child to go to time out.
  * It only leads to aggression, fights, and is not helpful in any way.
* Do NOT lock your child in a room for a time out.
  * Locking leads to escalation of aggressive behavior, crying, and tantrums.
  The child will naturally try to get out which is a normal reaction to being locked in any place.
  * You may use a warning ONCE of taking away a privilege if the child leaves time out.
  If the warning does not work, use taking away the privilege as a punishment.
* Walking away *is HARD*.
  Practice it. Not getting into arguments is crucial.
* **`Time In`** is used to develop the positive behavior while child is not in time out.
  It is natural to neglet the good behavior we see.
  Time in requires careful attention.
  * Moreover, the total praise should *outweight* the punishments in order to build a habit.
  * If the punishement is happening very frequently, it is a signal that praise is not happening often enough.

### FAQ <!-- omit in toc -->

> So is using time outs really an effective tool to change behavior?

It depends on how it's used actually.
Time out should be coupled with time in to be efficient.

> Why are the brief time outs recommended for changing the behavior?

The researches show that prolonged time outs (> 10 minutes) do not result in bigger or prolonged positive effects at all.

We also want child as soon as possible back into the normal situation so that positive reinforcement gets a chance of happening.

## 11. Consequences â€• Spanking and Alternatives

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Physical (corporal) punishment`** is any physical contact or hitting.
This is different from **child abuse**, however, which is a *severe* physical punishment, inducing extreme pain, physical marks, even open wounds, and often uses objects such as belts, sticks, and alike as a part of punishment.

Physical punishment is a sensitive topic because it is connected to one's religion, culture, or strong personal beliefs about what is appropriate to control child behavior. 

### Negative Effects <!-- omit in toc -->

* Increased aggression; disruptive and antisocial child behavior both at home and at schole.
* Poor academic achievements.
* Reduced ability to control impulsive behavior later in life.
* Higher rates of mental health problems for child- and adulthood. E.g. depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse.
* Increased risk of physical health problems. As far as earlier death due to the compromised immune system. Heart disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease also contribute to shorter life expectancy.

### Irony Of Physical Punishment <!-- omit in toc -->

Parents surveys show: the two most often reasons for use of the physical punishment are for aggression and non-compliance of their children.

The irony is that physical punishment will likely worsen the situtation with aggression while having little or no effect on compliance.

### FAQ <!-- omit in toc -->

> How come people still use punishment?

* Punishment is connected to our beliefs in child raising practices.
* When punishment is used, the negative activity stops that moment and that locks into the parents behavior.
  This connection in parent's mind is learned and is very strong.
  The ineffectiveness of the punishment is delayed and therefore does not have much impact on this learned connection, i.e. it's hard to *un*learn it.
  This is called "the punishment trap".
  It is observed that the aggressive actions (doing or watching them) can activate the "reward centers" in the brain.

# Week 3 <!-- omit in toc -->

## 12. Troubleshooting: The Basics

It *is* possible that a particular technique will not work with a child.
However, often the case the technique is not applied correctly and this leads to a failure.

Troubleshooting is:

* figuring out why the technique did not work;
* realizing how to fix the problem.

Troubleshooting can turn the program around in turn of its efficiency.

Focus on HOW you are using the tools!

### Signs Of The Need Of Troubleshooting <!-- omit in toc -->

* Change is not occuring.
* Change is too small or too slow.
* Change is not enduring.
* Problem occurs out of context, i.e. change occur but only when praise or points are given after behavior.
* Problem has gotten worse.

### Common Problems <!-- omit in toc -->

* Giving rewards for the arbitrary behaviors instead of the specific behaviors.
  * "Improvisation schemes" don't work.
  The consistent special response should be associated with specific behaviors and only with them.
* Parents giving too many reminders.
  * Repeated prompts (TODO_LINK) decrease the likelyhood of the repeated behavior.
  If the child does not do what is asked, request less of the behavior and then go help the child carry that out.
* Strategic issues.
  * Reward programs (TODO_LINK) do not work well *alone*.
  * Prompts (TODO_LINK) do not work well *alone*.
  * Antecedents (TODO_LINK) and Consequences (TODO_LINK) used together **do work**.

### Troubleshooting Checklist <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Check your prompts and positive setting events.
   1. Are the prompts (TODO_LINK) given *right before* you want the behavior to occur?
   2. Are positive setting events (TODO_LINK) being used?
2. Use Shaping (TODO_LINK) more efficiently. 
   1. Demand less behavior in the beginning.
   2. Break down the behavior to praise partial completion.
   3. Remember that "knowing is not the same as doing", and "having done once or twice is not the same as doing it consistently".
3. Check how praises (TODO_LINK) are delivered.
   Mediocre praise does not work.
   1. Praise the behavior **every** time.
   2. Check the immediacy and effusiveness.
4. Check your point program (TODO_LINK).
   1. Child should be excited to spend the points.
   I.e. is the child not willing to spend the points?
   1. Rewards should be based on child's interest.
5. If there are two or more adults in a home, work together to make sure that you're administering the program similarly.
   1. Consistently praise and reward behavior.
   2. It is okay to have just one parent administer the program as long as it's *consistent*.

### FAQ <!-- omit in toc -->

> What if I suspend the program?

It is fine to suspend the program temporarily *if you can not do it well*.
Doing the programm partially and well is better than keeping it going and doing it poorly.

> What if am divorced or separated, can I use the program just in my home?

Yes, you can.
Having the program going at least in one home is still likely to make a big difference in child's behavior improvement.

> What if I relapse into yelling at my child or even hitting? Have I undermined all of my progress?

That is not a catastrophy.
Just try to get back to the behavior change tools and techniques.
We are human beings and tend to make mistakes.
So lower the bar to a realistic level for yourself too.

## 13. Troubleshooting â€• Jumpstarting

### Jumpstarting <!-- omit in toc -->

Often, it's hard to just start the behavior to get going.
A technique called Jumpstarting (aka Response Priming) can help with that.
**`Jumpstarting`** is inviting a person to participate in the early part of a sequence or set of behaviors.

This is especially true when there's a sequence of actions need to be done in order to achieve the desired outcome.

TODO Example: Exercising delayed. Equipment...

The number of steps can result in accumulation of the great inertia that prevents doing the behavior.
This leads to not enough of the sequence to be generated, thus nothing to reward or to praise.

If the person is invited to only participate in an early part of the sequence, he or she is more likely to agree and actually do that.
Which in turn increases the likelihood of participation in at least the nest step of the sequence.
This is a great starting point for Shaping (TODO_LINK).

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

* Pair with shaping.
* Mention your child is allowed to stop after completing the first part.
* Give choice â€• your child can stop after first step or keep going.
* Remaining silent and letting the child keep going is an allowed option too.
* Praise taking the first step whether or not child continues the sequence.

It will make it easier to get the starting step of the sequence going the next time.

## 14. Troubleshooting â€• Consequence Sharing

**`Consequence sharing`** is providing a rewarding consequence to an individual for behavior, and giving the same reward to others.

* Used when one out of several children requires a behavior-change program.
* Used to share positive consequences â€• do not punish innocent child.

Benefits here include:

* Avoid a "me too" program. I.e. it tries to add fairness.
* Non-target children end up encouraging the target child to do the behaviors, often with specific statements or even directions.
* Target child values reward more when shared with non-target child.
* Non-target child improves his/her behavior.
  
## 15. Troubleshooting â€• Group Program

**`Group Program`** is a program that relies on providing a rewarding consequence to those involved, *only when all parties* have completed the behavior.

Use as a troubleshooting tool, or when you want the same behavior for more than one child.
Treat the group as a unit.
Praise the group as a unit.

## 16. Adolescents

The tools we can apply to adolescents are the same, but *how* they are applied is different.

### Risky Behaviors <!-- omit in toc -->

Adolescense is a period of engaging in risky behaviors.
Those which can lead to health problems, serious injuries, and death.
E.g. alcohol abusing, cigarets smoking, driving recklesly, engaing in unprotected sex, engaging in illegal activities.

Two factor influence the risky behavior the most.
First is the **presense of peers**.
Second is **not being monitored by parents**.
Monitoring does not mean being with child at all times or hovering.
Monitoring is keeping track of where the child is, with whom, and what she is doing.
Cell phones can help with monitoring.

Monitoring is important even when child is at home.
Keep an eye on computer, cell phone, tablet and similar devices usage.

### Brain Development <!-- omit in toc -->

The brain is not fully developed yet and is developing unevenly.
Decision making develops later vs sensation seeking develops early.

* Changes in physical (hormones, appearance, brain) and psychological (increases in hopelessness, body image problem) states.
* Many psychiatric disorder originate around this period.
* A lot of that is a result of stress.
  Adolescense are copign with things they may not even be aware of.

Parents' Relief of Path of Adolescense and Positive Influence.

### Praise <!-- omit in toc -->

* Praise quietly and calmly.
  * Sometimes, a private praise helps avoiding embarrassment.
* Use exact and concrete terms.
* Give a nonverbal gesture without touching.

### Attending and Planned Ignoring <!-- omit in toc -->

Ignore the undesired more often.
Most importantly, look carefully for the opportunities to praise the desired behavior.

### Use of Punishment <!-- omit in toc -->

Should play a minor role.
Should be brief and mild.

Time out is not an option anymore.
A brief loss of a privilege is a working option still.

The punishment will only increase the tension at home, that's why the focus should be on attending and planned ignoring.

### Compromise <!-- omit in toc -->

Make a special efforts to achieve compromise.
Over time children develop more autonomy, taste, preferences.
Peers also pose an enormous influence.

Try to compromise when you can.
E.g. bed time; messy room; strange outfits and appearances; curfew.

Consider bending on behaviors that are likely to be temporary and are not dangerous.

Expand the areas you're willing to compromise.
Teens want more independence.

The myth of the *slippery slope*.
The opposite is more likely.
Compromising provides a model of what is it to be reasonable and how two people disagree but come to terms without a fight.
Compromising on some issues will likely strenghten your word or rules in places you can not compromise.
This also cements positive facets of relationship in a difficult period.

### Negotiating <!-- omit in toc -->

Negotiation is a *process* of getting to a compromise.

The opposite of the negotiation is making a decision on child's behalf.

Negotiation steps:

* Listen without interrupting, pay attention to his side of the story.
* Be respectful of the child. Withold judgement (which can even be conveyed by the body language).
  * This conveys the content is being taken seriously.
* Focus on the presen, not the past.
  * Referring to the past may jeopardize the process.
* Stay on subject at hand.
  * Doing otherwise undermines the "listening" in child's eyes and gives a signal "parent doesn't understand".
* Provide a few alternatives without being authoritative.
  * "Have you considered these alternatives?"

### Engage In Problem Solving With Adolescense <!-- omit in toc -->

* Identify and state the problem.
* Prompt and encourage strategies to solutions.
* Identify several ways to handle the problem.
* For each of the possible ways identify the possible consequences and characterize them.
* Select the best way in terms of consequences.
* Role play the situation and the selected solution.
  * Constructive tone is helpful.
  * Don't hesitate to start over or switch the roles.

# Week 4 <!-- omit in toc -->

## 17. Nurturing Family Environment

### Promote Open Communication <!-- omit in toc -->

* Realize *telling* child to talk to you will *not be enough to open lines of communication*.
* Be an especially good listener *without interruption or judgement*.
  * It does not mean hold back your views, just delay giving an advice.
* Model open communication by talking about your day.

### Build Positive Relatives Relationships <!-- omit in toc -->

The quality of interaction with relatives outside the home adds a great value in promotive positive behaviors.
It is important for a child to have another trusted person who she can talk to.
Children with positive family connections do better at school and are less likely to show behavior problems as they get older.

* Be sure child is present when visiting relatives.
* Invite relatives over.
* Schedule virtual hangout.

### Routines And Rituals <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Routines and rituals`** are regular and predictable activities.

These do not have to be religious activities, even those certainly would qualify.

Quality of family life is greatly affected by reguraly scheduled activities which give structure to the week, or the month, or the year.
Regularity is greater than a particular period.
Such activities reduce stress or anxiety in children, as well as help avoiding risky behavior in teens.

* Aim for regularity and frequency such as once a week.
* Establish a few routines inside and outside the home.

### Positive Social Behavior <!-- omit in toc -->

Another focus should be on promoting positive social beahvior especially in childhood. E.g. getting alone with others, cooperating, being sensitive.

Temperament and propensity to socialize differ from child to child greatly.
Some join games with others immediately.
Some are more hesitant.
Nevertheless, it is important for children to learn to be around peers and get alone.

Kids who know how to interact with others do better at school, and are less likely to engage into risky behavior when reach teenage.

Over the last few decades we've observed the shift in preparing kids to school.
In the past, it was recommended to get the children engaged into academic activities (reading, counting) as early as possible.
Now, the recommendation is to make children know how to interact with others, cooperate, play together, share, and listen to adults.

* Increase the number of opportunities for your child to be social. Play date, sleep over, neighbor kids.
* Monitor how the child is doing.
  * Notice the negative social behavior.
  * Use prompts.
  * Praise positive behavior.
* Build a program with antecedents, shaping, and praise if needed.
* Develop one or more interests that involve peers.

### Develop Parental Flexibility <!-- omit in toc -->

Parents should make sure they are flexible.
Word "flexibility" here means ability to compromise when possible and more and more as the child grows up.
The opposite extreme is having clear and rigid statements like "do it because I said so".
This extreme moves *away* from the nurturing environment.

Rigid statements foster noncompliance.
Offering choice fosters compliance.

* Compromise (TODO_LINK).
* Negotiate (TODO_LINK).

### Monitoring <!-- omit in toc -->

As mentioned earlier, monitoring is a tool that helps preventing engagement in risky activities (TODO_LINK).

* Who is the child with?
* Where the child is?
* What is the child doing?
* How does the child uses computer, smartphones, and similar devices?

After-school time is the most difficult one to keep track of whether for two parents (both at work) or single parent.

Monitoring should be a *regular* activity.

* Build a routine of knowing where everyone in the family is.
  * Make it a *natural* activity.
  * It will not work if this activity has never been practiced and is introduced one day.
* Check in with your child via cell phone.
* Make your home a place where your child spends time with friends.
* Create a plan to monitor virtual activity.

### Minimize Stressors <!-- omit in toc -->

Stress is a normal part of everyone's life and can not be completely eliminated.
Yet, it's important to be alert of stressors of your child.
Examples include: demands from schoolwork, unsafe living conditions, unstable home environment, bullying, concerns about the body image, overly high expectations, negative thoughts and doubts about themselves.

The parents are usually unaware of the stress experienced by their children.
Kids often turn inward and just say everything is fine but actually they are suffering quietly.

Parents stress tends to spread around the home.
I.e. parents' stress affects the child state and adds up with child's existing stress.
This leads a few effects.
First is obvious, the child's stress increases.
But also, stress is a setting event (TODO_LINK), and antecedent that can lead to negative behavior.
A parent comes home stressed, says something but the child doesn't comply because stress in the parent's voice is an antecedent for getting noncompliance.
In addition to that, the stress can be an antecedent for other things such as low quality of sleep at night results in problems at school the next day.

***Continuous* stresses result disrupt routines which in turn results in noncompliance and anxiety**.

* Avoid conflict, mean comments, harsh punishement, or family chaos.
* Maintain routines and rituals as consistent as possible to stabilize child's behaviors.

### Self-Care <!-- omit in toc -->

Stress not just influences child's behavior.
It can speed up aging process and negatively affect the immune system (incl. enduring changes).

Do see your own needs to protect yourself.
Do care self-practice alone and with your spouse.
It will also work as a model (TODO_LINK) for your child.

* Build relationships outside of the home.
* Make time for yourself.
* Enjoy a hobby.
* Participate in activities.

## 18. Common Misconceptions

If your usual child rearing practices work, there might be no need to resort to any of the behavior changing tools at all.

Obstacles to efficiency of the tools are:

* The concepts (praise, time out, prompts) are familiar, however the application details are crucial.
  If not applied correctly, the tools lose their efficiency.
* Parents have beliefs, experiences, inclination about how to rear our child
  All of them affect how we interact and influence our child.
  And some of the beliefs are contrary to what the studies show about them.

### List of Misconceptions <!-- omit in toc -->

> *"Punishment will change the behavior."*

* No, it doen't make enduring changes.
* No, increasing the intensity of punishment does not make it any more effective.
* No, punishment increases aggression and disconnects from the paren, leads to poor school performance, health problems, etc.
* No, punishment doesn't teach children positive behavior, *it teaches how to punish others though.*
* Worse, punishing is self-maintaining (locks in the parent's mind, aka *"punishment trap"*).

> *"Explaining why a behavior is wrong will lead child to stop doing the behavior."* 

* Yes, explanation does play a role in child development.
  * Teaching by modeling.
  * Teaching complex psychological processes such as thinking, problem solving, reasoning.
  * Teaching concepts, words, languages.
* No, explanation is not an efficient tool for changing the behavior in people (both children or adults).
  * Explanation may change attitude, but very unlikely to change any behavior.
  * No, explanation is not a replacement for practice.

> *"Providing a lot of praise will spoil a child."*

* No, praise is a strongest tool for development of the positive behavior in the child.
  * It is very unlikely to praise children too much in the first place.
  Actually, we're just being nice a lot.
  We have a natural inclination to be critical and to see things that are going wrong, than to be supportive and noticing the good things.
* No, praise is associated with many positive effects.
  * Stronger child connections to adults.
  * Children like more the situations where the praise is provided.
* No, the *special praise* only needs to target the specific behaviors we're trying to correct in the child.

> *"If child knows the behavior or has done it once or twice, he/she can do it regularly.*

* No, knowing and doing are very connected in humans.
* No, for the behavior to really become consistent ("lock in"), the praise should be used each time the behavior occurs.

> *"When my child refuses somehing she's just being manipulative."*

* No, children are actually much less manipulative than adults.
  * Coming up with strategies that affect adult's behavior is beyond children's abilities.
* No, the child is not manipulative because we can turn the opposition into compliance with behavior-change program.

> *"Reminding a child is a way to get the behaviors we wish."*

**`Reminder`** is a repeated verbal prompt to get the child to do something.

* Yes, reminders are fine when we want the behavior to happen once.
* No, by themselves reminders don't get the desired behavior change, rather it becomes nagging.
* Often, the repeated reminders are seen by the parents as a ground for punishment.

## 19. School Behaviors â€• Handling Problems

Examples include: fighting, teasing, bullying, interfering with work of others, not completing assignments at school, not bringing homework assignments home, and getting upset when transitioning from one activity to another.

In some sense, the common problems are emerging and are a function of the grade.
This is because the older the child is, the more homework assignment they will receive and need to get done.

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

The special intervention technique called **`Home-based reinforcement program`** can be helpful.
As the name suggests, much of the program is carried out at home but is based on the behaviors that child is doing at school.
It involves parent, teacher, and a child, and uses shaping, praise, point programs, and positive opposites. (TODO_LINK)

Usually, it's the teached who alerts abour the problem in the first place.
The program uses teacher's input but does not require a lot of teacher's effort which is why teachers are often eager to help with such programs.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

* Teacher + Parents: Identify the problem behavior.
  * Get to the point, use precise terms.
  The details help in deciding the strategy and will help monitoring the process of child behavior improvement.
  **Write them down** so that you and the teached can agree on concerns.
  * Select just one teacher or class.
  If we can achieve the behavior in one class, we can easily extend that to other classes later.
* Teacher + Parents: Create a system the teacher can use to measure the child's behavior.
  * Ask teacher to grade the child every day.
  * Typically 3 by 5 index cards are used for that.
  The teacher would tick off 0, 1, or 2 for how the child performed that day.
  * Texts, emails, or phone calls tend to be much less efficient than cards.
  Often, the activit gets forgotten.
  More importantly, the child does not get a *clear and immediate feedback* of that card.
  * The system should define the levels or the grades.
  0 means the behavior was the problem; no positive behavior change at all.
  1 means minor improvement in behavior.
  And 2 means that the behavior is a lot better most of the time.
* Parents: Devise a home-based reward program.
  * A point program that is rewarded daily based on a teacher's report.
  You may give 1 point for the grade 1 on the teacher's index card.
  If the teacher gives 2, you may either give 2 points as well or even 3 or 4 to motivate the child stronger to develop the behavior.
  Another thing is rewarding consistency in good behavior.
  If the child gets a 2 on a given day, she gets 2 points.
  But if she gets 2s in a row, she gets and extra (bonus) point.
  * Have 4 or 5 rewards with different prices, both low (just 1 or 2 points) and high (10 or more points).
  Scale can look like: 2, 2, 3, 5, 10.
  The key is in making sure **there is no delay in earning points and buying something**.

### Responding <!-- omit in toc -->

### Responding To 0 <!-- omit in toc -->

If the child brings home a 0, which means no improvement in behavior.
It is important that you be calm, do not lecture, and do not make the interaction adversive.
No complaining, no asking why the child didn't do well.

So you say: "It's good that you brought the card back."
And then you continue: "You did not earn a point today, but you will have another chance tomorrow."
Or "I can not give you points today but I am sure you'll have a better day tomorrow."

If the child starts arguing about the ranking, either walk away or start another topic.

### Responding To 1 <!-- omit in toc -->

If the child brings home a 1, which means she did a little bit better.
Praise it and be specific.
"The teacher gave you a 1, which must mean you were sitting at your desk most of the time and that was very nicely done. Nice job!"

Praise any sign of improvement!
Keep in mind **shaping**.

### Responding To 2 <!-- omit in toc -->

If the child brings home a card with a 2, which meand good behavior was performed most of the time.
Praise the perfect score **enthusiastically** and give high points!

## 20. School Behaviors â€• Building Competencies

Some skills and competencies that are needed for being successful at school.
Often, basic experience parents are able to provide their children can help being better students.
E.g. providing a stimulating environment; reading to child and stopping to discuss what is being read; re-reading the same books over again; having child reading to parent or at least explaining to the parent what is happening on the pictures.

The program recommended below can be used outside of school.
It is especially useful for the summer months or other school breaks.
In the following example the program focuses on *reading and comprehension* because it is often the most difficult to children.
However, the program can be applied broadly.
The program utilizes other tools, but it is more than a point program.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

* Ask your child what topics are of the most interest.
  * You can use a magazine as a starting point if the child has a problem picking a topic.
  * Use the materials that of the child's reading level.
* Develop a point program for *talking* about the area of interest.
  * Points are given for things that child learnt from the sources such as magazine.
  * Talking does not have to be long; 1-2 minutes is enough â€• it is important to not be too demanding.
  * Have a backup point program.
  * Have charts that illustrate points earned and spent.
* Remember to praise! and Remember to keep program pressure-free.
  * Pay attention to efforts.
  * It's okay for child to ask for help with reading.

This program is casual and fun and also gives the child a rare opportunity to be in control and teach parents and others.

The program can be enhanced by modeling the behavior you want to instill in your children.
Parents and other adults can report what they have read on a particular day.
It is okay to make such practice a routine where everyone gets a chance to speak about what they learned.
Just keep it pressure-free.

## 21. Seeking Professional Help â€• Identification

So far the regular parental challenges were covered.
This section is dedicated to more extremes behavior which go beyond normal challenges.

Three important points on psychological problems:

* Many of them are not binary, but are on a continuum.
  * Depression, hyperactivity, autism spectrum disorder may have symptoms of different intensity.
* If you're deliberating whether the child should get professional help or not, do get help.
  * Trust your intuition.
* Do NOT blame yourself for problems your child may have.
  * This is especially important for mothers who tend to blame themselves as the very first thing.
  * Only extreme parenting practices (e.g. harsh punishment or neglection) can lead to psychological problems.

### Impairment <!-- omit in toc -->

**RED FLAG**: **`Impairment`** occurs when a child's behavior interferes with meeting the usual demands and role expectations at home or at school.

For a toddler the normal behavior is sleeping, growing, engaging in normal activities at home.
There's not much demands or expectations here.

When a child goes to a preschool, the demands and expecations grow: like fitting in with others and following the routines in that setting.
There's still a little to expect or demand.
For example, if the child is not very social or does not sleep at the same time as others, that is totally normal and no cause for alarm.
However, if the child is frequently isolated in daycare or kicked out of preschool, these would qualify as impairment.

Impairments are more and more easily detected with the growth of the child and the corresponding expectations.
Aggressive behavior, high level of activity, anxiety, depression getting in the way of routine activities, and getting alone with peers are examples of impairment in children of older age.

### Dangerous Behaviors <!-- omit in toc -->

**RED FLAG**: The child is in danger to himself or others. (Notice the pattern and consistency.)

Examples include repeatedly being aggressive with a sibling, or cruel to a pet.
Playing with matches or setting fires.
Making threats to kill classmates or teachers.
Self-mutilation.
Thoughts of suicide.

The key is to evaluate the harmful actions and address the threats as soon as possible.

Hurting a sibling by accident or fighting with a bully is not a sign of an issue.
But if these things happen regularly, special help should be seeked.

### Unusual Behaviors <!-- omit in toc -->

**RED FLAG**: Engaging in unusual or questionable behaviors.

Does your child engage in endless, repetitive behaviors with toys of objects for hours on end?
Do they see things that aren't there?
Or believe that some spirit is in control of their minds or hearing voices that tell them to do harmful or dangerous things?
All of these require professional help.

But take age into consideration.
A five year old muttering to himself and two or three different voices while playing with soldiers or toy hospital is quite normal.
Much of early childhood and normal development includes imaginary play, imaginary friends, dialogues with animals, etc.
The same done by a 12 year old, being alone in the place, especially happening more that once is a sign of a problem.

### Change In Behavior <!-- omit in toc -->

**RED FLAG**: A sudden and sustained deviation to a pattern of the things the child likes or does may be a cause for concern.

E.g. an abrupt change from doing fine or adequately at school to doing very poorly.
Similarly, sleeping, or eating, or signs of anxiety could be another indicator.

Struggling with a single subject matter is not a pointer to an issue.
But if there's a drastic change across the subjects, rather suddenly, then you may want to seek guidance.

### Distress <!-- omit in toc -->

**ATTENTION**: Is your child showing signs of stress that coincide with exposure to some event or stressor?

A. What is going on in child's life?
B. What is child's reaction.

Many events can lead to signs of distress.
E.g. loss of a parent, divorce, moving to another city, starting a new school, natural disasters that lead to changes in living conditions.
Most of these things will result in psychological problems that are marked but temporary (up to a few months) aka *problems of adjustment*.

Even temporary reaction that will pass may require treatment if the child shows extreme distress.

Sometimes it is difficult to tell if the child is having a difficult times.
This is because depression anxiety and withdrawals are more inward focused but don't usually result in conflicts or clashes with the environment.

### Unmanageable <!-- omit in toc -->

**RED FLAG**: child is difficult or impossible to control with the common measures.

The child may be doing fine at school but is completely unmanageable at home.
Or the other way around.
Each case is a ground for seeking professional help.

## 22. Seeking Professional Help â€• Execution

### Evaluation <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Evaluation`** is the process of mental health professional interviewing a child and a parent in order to make a diagnosis.

A casual chat will not work here.
Professionals are using standard interviews designed specially for these purposes.

During an interview the parent can be asked about the following areas of child's life:

* What are the sympthoms and behaviors of concern?
* How does the child function in everyday life?
* What is the current family situation?
* Are there potential stressful events in child's life?

There might be a physical exam or lab tests also in case something medical is involved.

### Treatment <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Treatment`** is a course of action based on the child's diagnosis provided by mental health professional.

Expect medications, or psychological techniques, or both to be used for achieving positive changes.
In some cases, the treatment is intensive and is provided under direct care of a professional specially trained in these techniques.
There are effective treatments for many psychological problems and hence there is room for hope that changes can be made in what your child is experiencing.

### Seeking Services <!-- omit in toc -->

**Use only reliable sources of information!**
Go to a source that based on the US Government Evaluation of Treatment or from a professional organization that focuses on mental health and considers the research on effective treatments.

* Your State's Psychological Association.
* National Institute of Mental Health.
* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
* Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
* American Psychological Association.
* American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry.
* American Academy of Pediatrics.

The professional you're going to should be credentialed and licensed by state or province.

Ask questions:

* What is the treatment you provide for my child's problems?
* How long have you been providing this treatment?
* Has this particular treatment been studies, and does it have scientific evidence in its favor?
* What are treatment options other than the one you provide?

**Lock for evidence-based treatments.**
