## _My_ Challenge <!-- omit in toc -->

> I encourage you to begin the course with a specific challenge in mind in relation to your child or adolescent.

Figure out a way to:
* drink more with less resistance.
* be able to listen a complete short story without much interruption or rushing through pages.
* get teeth brushed every morning and evening without fuss.

## Key Ideas

* **Temporary tools to achieve permanent effects**.
* **It is _Practice_ that builds habits of doing good things/not doing bad things**.

# Week 1 <!-- omit in toc -->

## Components of behavior development

A â€• B â€• C

***A*ntecedents** refers to what can be done _before_ behavior takes place to make the desired behaviors more likely to occur.

***B*ehavior** refers to what you can do to get the specific behaviors you wish.

***C*onsequences** is what we do _after_ the behavior is completed.

## 1. Praise

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Praise`** is a way of expressing one's approval.
It's a temporary program to make permanent changes.
Get the behavior, then you stop praising for that.
It is _a_ tool among others â€• don't expect it to work alone.

Mechanics: Support repeated practice to build habit(s).

This will _not_ spoil a child.

### Kinds <!-- omit in toc -->

1. routine ("praise in everyday life") â€• helps maintaining relationship;
2. changing/developing behavior â€• better suited.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

* Select the behavior to praise in advance and then look for it to appear.
* **Be VERY enthusiastic!**
   ~ Gestures + facial expression + up tone of voice.
* **State exactly what is being praised.**
   E.g. "Great! You've picked up toys just like I asked you!"
* **Use non-verbal supporting actions:** Hugs, kisses, high-five, etc.

### Effectiveness <!-- omit in toc -->

* Timely, ideally praise immediately after the desired behavior occured.
* Praise even the small increments of behavior.

### EXAMPLE <!-- omit in toc -->

TODO


### Caution <!-- omit in toc -->

* Do not apply routine praise to change behavior â€• it doesn't work that way.
* Do not praise the person.
   E.g. "You're a good girl because you did/did not do X" â€• BAD!
* Do not love depends on behavior.
   E.g. "Daddy loves you because you did/did not do X" â€• BAD!
* Do not focus on yourself.
   E.g. "You make daddy happy when you do X" â€• BAD!
* Do not "caboose".
   I.e. no extra phrases after the praise like "why don't you always do X?" â€• BAD!

## 2. Antecedents

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Antecedent`** is an action or statement that increase the likelyhood the behavior will occur.

Whether the behavior will occur more or less likely depends on the delivery.
Half-joke example:

> â€• She: If you _really loved me_ you would go to the family event with me.
> 
> â€• He: If _you really loved me_ you would not even ask me to go.

### Kinds <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Prompts â€• direct ways to guide behavior usually in a form of instruction.
   * Verbal: "Please put away your toys".
   * Physical: Walking child to a bathroom to brush teeth holding him/her by hand.
   * Visual: "Here, let me show you how to brush your teeth."
2. Positive Setting Events â€• indirect ways to guide behavior by setting the stage.
   * Usually is related to _how_ something is said or presented.
3. Negative Setting Events â€• indirect ways to decrease the behavior you want.
   * Harsh tone alone or limiting choice are likely to make child not follow instructions. E.g. "do it because I said so", "I am the parent and you have to do this".
   * Aggressive orders are not the way to build habits.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

* **Be clear and specific.**
  General prompts are less effective than the specific ones.
  - E.g. "Pick up five pieces of cloth before coming to dinner" or "Pick up all clothes from the floor and move them to the laubdry room" are better than "Go clean your room".
* **Consider how you're making a request.**
  - Use gentle tone of voice, and matching facial expression to increase the chances of compliance.
* **Offer choices**.
   It increases chances child will comply right away.
* **Say *please***.
   It may be helpful because it is normally said in soft voice and implies choice.
* **Offer assistance**.
   It conveys a gentle mindset, willing to be there, and readiness to attend child.
   Sometimes, starting a thing is the most difficult part.
   Start assistance â€•> observe when behavior appears â€•> withdraw assistance.
* **Use playful challenge** (or even a couple of time in a raw).
   Prolong practice and achieve behavior locking earlier.
   "I bet you can't do it twice in a raw."

### FAQ <!-- omit in toc -->

> I give prompts all day and trust me they don't work at all.

Well, giving too many prompts too often is called *nagging*.

Prompts get the behavior going but praise is needed to support it.

> How long do I have to keep giving prompts to see the positive results?

Key is: how often can you praise the behavior.
When you see behavior after a prompt was given, **praise it**.
When you see behavior without a prior prompt, **REALLY PRAISE IT!**

Normally it can take somewhere between 1 to 3 weeks.
The tools are **designed for short-term use but they lead to long-term change**.

## 3. Behaviors â€• Shaping

*How can we get to behavior of the child that we'd like to see?*

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Shaping`** is rewarding small steps that begin to approximate (resemble) the desired behavior.

E.g. Start with 10 minutes of homework per day if want to achieve 1 hour.
Want a child to clear all the dishes from the dinner table => start with just one.

> When you develop _listening to you_ or _complience_ in one place, it carries over to other places.

Give special praise child for showing the behavior for _easy_ requests first.
This will increase chances of behavior in other situtaions.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

* Choose behaviors you'd like.
* Select a small step.
* Choose the consequence you will use (praise or points).
* Notice and reinforce the instances of behavior.
* When behavior instances occur consistently, make the requirement slightly .bigger
  * if you _don't_ see the progress, try to make the requirement smaller.

### EXAMPLE <!-- omit in toc -->

TODO


### FAQ <!-- omit in toc -->

> Why do I need to do shaping at all, my child knows how to do the behavior?

Knowing is not the same as doing. The idea is to make the child practicing the behavior and carry it over to different contexts.

> What if my child does not even do the first step in shaping?

Make the step smaller.
Provide a little help to get things going â€• it is totally fine. If it does not work still, try to use the [**Simulation technique**](#4-behaviors--simulation).

### Caution <!-- omit in toc -->

Avoid ineffective use!

* Do not set bar too high in the beginning.
* Avoid "slippery slope thinking".
  > "If I have to help little now, I will need to always keep helping".
  This is not true at all.
* Remember to praise but understand that shaping is not done for praise but for repetative practice and building a habit.

## 4. Behaviors â€• Simulation

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Simulation`** consists of making up practice opportunities to engage in the behavior in game-like, role-play, pretend situation.

It is intended to getting the behavior you'd like to see in your child (Or stop the behavior you don't want the child to do which she is doing a lot).

Simulation uses [**antecedents**](#2-Antecedents), [**praises**](#1-Praise), [**points**](#7-Consequences--Point-Programs), and developing [**positive opposites**](#6-Consequences--Positive-Opposite) techniques.

The idea is to build the behavior in artificial environment and then carry it over to real life situations.

For the simulation is important _how_ you do things, not just what you do.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

**Prerequisite**: Pressure-free, anxiety-free environment and time.
Make it fun!

* Choose a behavior to be corrected.
* Explain the game clearly.
* Play the game.
* Praise effusively.
* Use a playful challenge to repeat the practice one or two times.

### EXAMPLE <!-- omit in toc -->

TODO


### FAQ <!-- omit in toc -->

> If it looks so fake, how can it teach the behavior that will be used in every day situations?

Practice makes habits.
Habits do carry over from one situation to another.

> How often should I play the game?

Maybe one time a day.
Try including a challenge to repat the game.
Do praise the instances the behavior when you see them.

### Caution <!-- omit in toc -->

## 5. Behaviors â€• Modeling

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Modeling`** is a systematic tool that incorporates learning by observing and seeing the behavior of others rather than performing that behavior.

As it was said earlier, practice is crucial for learning, however the _initial learning_ often comes from observing.

Accidental observation of some behavior _is_ an example of modeling too.
E.g. daddy sweard,then the baby repeats the bad word.
Another example: children discipline their peers the same way their parents discipline them.

Children learn from diffent observed people, but parents modeling influence is the greatest due to the role in the child's life, the amount of time spent together, and the special relationship.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

* Select a characteristic to be developed.
* Define the characteristic by listing examples.
  * A few _concrete_ samples will suffice.
  The picked-up knowledge will be inferred, and carried over from the examples provided.
* Model the behavior as the occasions arise.
   Mentioned what you did when you're modeling the behavior.
* Praise any instance when child practices the bahavior.

Related: **Askable parent** â€• a parent child can come to ask about anything.
Remember to converse with the child about what is going on in your life.
If nothing happened today, tell a story about the past.
This sets and example of openness and willing to talk that the child will likely follow.

### EXAMPLE <!-- omit in toc -->

TODO


* TODO Alcohol abuse.
* TODO Parent shouting at children on the beach.

### FAQ <!-- omit in toc -->

> How effective is modeling in changing my child?

No guarantees here.
Children have different behavioral tendencies and parents can't change everything they want just because they provide modeling opportunities.
But parents are greatly increasing the chances of the positive changes in behavior.
Targeted modeling coupled with appropriate praise can be very efficient.

> How will I know modeling is working at all?

The efficiency of modeling depends on how often the desired behavior is demonstrated.
Sometimes, the child picks it up right away, but often it takes some time to develop.
Some behaviors occur very late in child's life, even when get their own children.

> Is there a way to determine which of my behaviors will be picked up by my child?

Probably not.
However, the most frequently demonstrated behaviors are the most likely to be learned.
What parents or other important people do is more likely to be picked up than what less important people do.

## 9. Consequences â€• Punishment Basics

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Punishment`** is any consequence that follows behavior and decreases or is intended to decrease the likelihood of the behavior in the future.

It is important to understand all the effects of punishment.
Keep in mind is not an efficient tool with dangers associated.
It should only be administered as a supplement to other techniques.

### Kinds <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Presenting something undesireable or negative after a behavior occurs.
   E.g. Reprimands, shouting, hitting.
2. Taking away something positive after a behavior.
   E.g. Taking away an activity, privilege, or event.
   In [**points program**](#7-Consequences--Point-Programs) â€• the points can be taken away.
3. Using some effort or some task to be performed.
   E.g. a chore, or cleaning up something.

### Direct Effects <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Stop the behavior *in the moment* of the interruption.
2. Does **not** stop the behavior beyond the moment.
   The child will keep engaging into the behavior in future.
3. Parents tend to escalate the intencity and frequency or both over time.
   Such escalation increases crying and pain associated with the punishment but does **not** increase the effectiveness or teaches the behavior you'd like.

I.e. the effects are immediate but not enduring.

### Negative Side Effects <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Emotional reactions.
   E.g. crying, arguing, striking a parent.
2. Escape and avoidance.
   * When a parent delivers more punishment than praise, the child often try to distance themselves from the persons who punish them, both physically and psychologically.
   This straints the relationship between a parent and a child.
   * Similarly, the activity that is being used as a punishment may start being avoided too, however it actually may be a desired activity which we want children to like, such as doing (extra) homework, exercising, and so on.
3. Increase in aggressive behavior with you.
   That applies to contacts or any force applied during punishment.
   E.g. hitting, holding tight, physically force the child to [**Time Out**](#10-consequences--time-out-from-reinforcement) all lead to aggression.
4. Increase in aggressive behavior with others.
   Punish technique [**models**](#5-behaviors--modeling) the child tends to use with his/her peers.
   E.g. punishment by hitting âŸ¶ fights on playground, punishment byshouting âŸ¶ yelling at school.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

The **effective** punishment uses the following is done like this:

* Select a behavior to decrease.
   Writing down is a good idea.
* Identify the positive opposite of this behavior.
   It is even more important to write it down so that you know how you will be [**attending**](#8-consequences--attending--planned-ignoring) and [**praising**](#1-praise) them.
* Reward the positive opposite.
* Select a brief punishment *ahead of time*.
   E.g. time out, loss of privilege.
   **KEEP THE PUNISHMENT MILD.**
* Praise much more often than punish.

## 10. Consequences â€• Time Out from Reinforcement

### Definition <!-- omit in toc -->

**`Time Out of Reinforcement`** â€• a brief period of time in which the child does not have access to the usual rewards in the situation.

It's a break from the attention and rewards available.
Examples of such rewards can be just being in the presence of others; receiving parent/peer attention; or participating in an ongoing game.

When in time out place, the child can not participate in activities and is not engaged into any conversations with anyone.
Time out is NOT related to thinking about what was done wrong, because it does not help building habits or change behavior.

During the time out the child should be let alone, but safe and supervised.
No talking.
No playing.
The time out place should not offer interesting activities; ideally it's a boring place.

Remember, however, that time out can only suppress the negative behavior but *does not teach* the positive one.

### Ingredients <!-- omit in toc -->

* Decide what warrants a time out.
  * The child should know what those punishable behaviors are.
  Be explicit and specific about it.
  Write them down.
* Decide where to have a time out.
  * Should be boring but safe place that allows supervising.
* Decide the duration of a timeout.
  * 2 to 5 minutes work fine.
  10 minutes is a practical maximum.
* Have a back up punishing event in case the child does not go to time out.
  * Be ready to take a way something.
  Offer a choice in a calm manner.
  E.g. if you don't go to time out now, you're not watching TV tonight.
  If the child does not comply, announce the immediate punishment and go away: Okay, you're not watching TV tonight.
  No arguments â€• it's too late.
* Explain how time out works.
  * Do it just to practice compliance in a tension-free environment.
* Keep an eye on the positive opposite behaviors during the *time in* and praise them.

### EXAMPLE <!-- omit in toc -->

### Caution <!-- omit in toc -->

* Do NOT physically force your child to go to time out.
  * It only leads to aggression, fights, and is not helpful in any way.
* Do NOT lock your child in a room for a time out.
  * Locking leads to escalation of aggressive behavior, crying, and tantrums.
  The child will naturally try to get out which is a normal reaction to being locked in any place.
  * You may use a warning ONCE of taking away a privilege if the child leaves time out.
  If the warning does not work, use taking away the privilege as a punishment.
* Walking away *is HARD*.
  Practice it. Not getting into arguments is crucial.
* **`Time In`** is used to develop the positive behavior while child is not in time out.
  It is natural to neglet the good behavior we see.
  Time in requires careful attention.
  * Moreover, the total praise should *outweight* the punishments in order to build a habit.
  * If the punishement is happening very frequently, it is a signal that praise is not happening often enough.

### FAQ <!-- omit in toc -->

> So is using time outs really an effective tool to change behavior?

It depends on how it's used actually.
Time out should be coupled with time in to be efficient.

> Why are the brief time outs recommended for changing the behavior?

The researches show that prolonged time outs (> 10 minutes) do not result in bigger or prolonged positive effects at all.

We also want child as soon as possible back into the normal situation so that positive reinforcement gets a chance of happening.
